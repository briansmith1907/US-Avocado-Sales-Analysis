This dashboard mainly focuses on the analysis of Hass avocado prices and volumes in the United States from 2015 to early 2018 for avocado suppliers and marketers. The data consists of a weekly data for over 3 years. The average price indicates the price per pound of avocado, and the features “Hass Small, Large, XLarge” indicate the actual size of the avocados and how many pounds of each size have been sold.

In our analysis, we can see that whenever the volume of avocados decrease, there is an increase in prices, and vice-versa. The increase in prices is most apparent in the 3rd and 4th quarters of each year, which is generally towards the end of Hass avocado season. The increase in volume and decrease in prices is usually reflected in the months of March when the avocado season begins and crops start to get picked.

Between 2015 and 2016, there’s about 10% increase in volumes sold and more than 11% increase in total $ sales. Between 2016 and 2017, there’s a 2.5% increase in volumes sold and almost 20% increase in total $ sales. Therefore, 2017 has been a good year overall, and both the volume and the total $ sales are increasing each year as avocados get more popular nationwide. 

Looking at our regional map, we can see that Western and Southwestern regions are where the bulk of the volumes are sold and the Northeast is another region where avocado sales are starting to increase substantially. Also, in the Market Analysis Tab, we can see the cities and regions selling the most volumes, generating the most revenues, or having the highest year-over-year increases. 

In the Price/Volume Analysis Tab, we can record the changes in the average avocado prices using time series analysis. We can see a slightly negative correlation of avocado prices and volumes sold. We can also see that small sized avocados are generally the most popular than large and x-large sized avocados.
